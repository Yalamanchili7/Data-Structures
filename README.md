Implementation of ADT's
In this project we will design, develop and demonstrates matrix ADT , Vector ADT, Set ADT’s 
and polynomial ADT with appropriate algorithms which covers all the operations of Matrix 
ADT, Vector ADT, Set ADT’s and polynomial ADT. In the Matrix ADT we will implement 
the following operations on the Matrix like Matrix addition, Matrix subtraction, Matrix 
multiplication, Matrix scalar multiplication, Matrix transpose in Matrix ADT. In Vector ADT 
the Vector class will implement the following operations like Vector length, Vector inner (dot 
product), Vector angle, Vector 3D Class, Vector Cross Product in Vector ADT. We will 
implement the Set ADT for the operations like Union, Intersection, Difference, Subset, Find, 
Empty, Is_Empty, Cardinality, Iterate, and Enumerate, Create, Createwith- capacity, Insertion, 
Remove. In Polynomial ADT Operations include returning the degree, extracting the 
coefficient for a given exponent, addition, multiplication, as well as more elaborate operations 
like Euclidean division, and properties related to roots of polynomials. Finally we Integrate all 
the above functions/methods of the Vector class and we must implement the methods to appear 
in this file. The running time/Time complexity of the routines developed are compared with 
other datastructures and proved to be efficient.
